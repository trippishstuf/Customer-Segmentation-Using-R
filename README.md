#Customer-Segmentation-Using-R
Customer Behavior Analysis and
Revenue Insights for a Retail Business

Introduction:

In this data analysis and customer segmentation project, we have a dataset from a company that sells products. The primary objective is to understand the dataset, perform data cleaning, and then use clustering techniques to segment customers based on their buying behavior. Customer segmentation can help the company tailor its marketing strategies, understand customer preferences, and improve overall business performance.

Modules Used:

1. **Data Cleaning (STEP 1):** In this module, we clean the dataset to ensure that it is ready for analysis. We handle missing values, identify and remove canceled invoices, and perform other data preprocessing tasks.

2. **Feature Extraction (STEP 2):** This module involves extracting relevant features from the data that can be used for analysis. Features include date-related information, total price, and description length.

3. **RFM Analysis (STEP 3):** Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics are calculated for each customer. These metrics are used for customer segmentation and understanding customer behavior.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this section, we explore the data to gain insights into customer behavior and sales patterns. We visualize revenue by country, revenue by month, revenue by day of the week, and identify the top customers by revenue.

5. **Market Basket Analysis (Optional):** We perform market basket analysis to identify associations between products that are often purchased together. This can help in improving product recommendations and sales strategies.

6. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering):** We use clustering techniques to segment customers based on their behavior, such as quantity and unit price. K-means clustering is used to group customers into distinct clusters.

7. **Outlier Detection (Optional):** We identify and remove outliers from the dataset to ensure that they do not unduly influence the analysis.

8. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** We calculate the Customer Lifetime Value for each customer, which provides insights into the long-term value of customers.

Overall, these modules provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and offer insights that can guide marketing strategies and business decisions. The choice of techniques and modules used can be tailored to the specific goals of the company and the nature of the dataset.
